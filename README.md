# pytrace
A function call tracker for Python.

## How to use me?
Simply download the script corresponding to your Python's version
into the directory containing the function you want to track and
add the following lines at the beginning of your script:

~~~
from pytrace import *
function_to_trace(the_function_you_will_track)
~~~

This will print function calls/returns in the console!

## Examples
- python2/example.py
